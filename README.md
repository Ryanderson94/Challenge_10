4. The application begins by loading in the data from the resources folder. This will allow you to perform the necessary analyses leveraging KMeans later on. This data will also be prepared by a number of functions.

5. Subsequently, the analysis begins first with the original data that has been prepared by the functions in the application, followed by a comparative analysis with PCA data. This comparative analysis allows the use to better understand the value of PCA data and explained variances. 

6. Lastly, the application illustrates the difference between the analyses using a side-by-side graphic, first with Elbow graphs, followed by scatter plots.
